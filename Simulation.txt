## Tools to simulate random numbers

## Simulate rolling 4 dice. randomly select 4 numbers 1 through 6
## The , replace option says that whatever number is picked, it can be picked again


sample(1:6, 4, replace = TRUE)



## Now what if I do not want to replace?

sample(1:20, 10)



## LETTERS is a variable in R that contains all of the letters in the alphabet

LETTERS



## The sample function can be used to rearrange a vector.

sample(LETTERS)



## 100 flips of a loaded coin

flips <- sample(c(0, 1), 100, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.3, 0.7))
flips



## How many heads is that?

sum(flips)



## We can also use the rbinom

rbinom(1, size = 100, prob = 0.7)



## Or we can flip 100 coins 1 time instead 1 coin 100 times

flips2 <- rbinom(100, size = 1, prob = 0.7)
flips2
sum(flips2)



## rnorm gets numbers from the normal distribution (mean 0 sd 1)

rnorm(10, mean = 100, sd = 25)




## 100 groups of 5 random numbers using poisson with a mean of 10

rpois(5, lambda = 10)
my_pois <- replicate(100, rpois(5, 10))
my_pois



## Now to get the means of each of the 5 groups

cm <- colMeans(my_pois)
cm



## Now to look at the distribution of this variable

hist(cm)
