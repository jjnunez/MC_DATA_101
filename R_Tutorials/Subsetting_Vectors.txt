## Subsetting vectors: how to extract elements in a vectors

## How to extract a vector that contains all of the non-missing cases

y <- x[!is.na(x)]
y



## All of the positive vectors

y[y > 0]




## extract all of the positive and non-missing cases at once

x[!is.na(x) & x > 0]



## How to extract specific cases

x [c(3, 5 , 7)]



## How to NOT extract specific cases in a vectors

x[c(-2, -10)]
##or
x[-c(2, 10)]



## Create a vector with "named" elements

vect <- c(foo = 11, bar = 2, norf = NA)
vect



## How to get just the names of the elements

names(vect)



## How to add names to the elements in a vector

vect2 <- c(11, 2, NA)
names(vect2) <- c("foo", "bar", "norf")



## How to check if two things are identical or not

identical(vect, vect2)



## How to get what is inside a "named" case

vect["bar"]
