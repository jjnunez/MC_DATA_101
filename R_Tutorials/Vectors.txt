## Vectors

num_vect <- c(0.5, 55, -10, 6)



## How to create a vector with logical values based on the vector above

tf <- num_vect < 1
tf



## Logical operators are < > <= >= == !=

## Putting together a character vector

my_char <- c("My", "name", "is")
my_char
paste(my_char, collapse = " ")



## To simply do that: sep separates by what is in between the quotes

paste("Hello", "world!", sep = " ")



## Joining numbers and characters:

paste(1:3, c("X", "Y", "Z"), sep = "")



## Vector recycling

paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = "-")
